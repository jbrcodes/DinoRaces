## Instructions

1. Clone the repo.
1. Install the Jest testing tool by typing `yarn`.
1. Review the challenge instructions in `Instructions.pdf`. However look at the tests to see what return values are expected, like `Dinosaur1` or `Human`. (There's only one "s" in "dinosaur." ðŸ˜Ž)
1. Complete the `dinoRace3(dino1, dino2, dino3, human)` function in file `dinoRaces.js`.
1. Test your function by typing `yarn test`.
1. Once you pass the tests, try to write the more flexible function `dinoRaceN(dinos, human)`, that takes as arguments an array of N dinos and one human.
1. To enable the tests for `dinoRaceN()`, change `xtest` to `test` in the second test suite in `dinoRaces.test.js`.
